# First-Time Configuration

You should configure some basic things:
```sh
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
$ git config --global ui.color true
```

---

# Log Viewers

Find a graphical log viewer that can show the commit graph:

* `gitg`: My preferred viewer, it shows the commit graph well:
  https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Apps/Gitg

* `gitk`: Comes with Git, but is quite poor in comparison to other
  viewers

* SourceTree: I've heard good things about this free viewer:
  https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/

* There are many more: http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis

---

# Merge Tools

When merging fails, Git can start a merge tool to help you resolve the
conflicts. I highly recommend investing some time in learning to use
one!

The best open source tool is KDiff3:
```sh
$ git config --global merge.tool kdiff3
$ git config --global mergetool.prompt off
```

---

# GitHub Workflow

* Fork repository on GitHub

* Clone the fork onto your computer with `git clone`

* Create a new feature branch from `master` with `git checkout -b`

* Make your changes, `git commit` as you go along

* Publish feature branch: `git push origin feature-X`

* Create a pull request on GitHub

* Get feedback, revise your branch with `git commit`, `git commit
--amend` or `git rebase -i`

* Re-publish your branch with `git push -f origin feature-X`
  (`--force` needed if you rewrote history)

---

# Commits to Avoid

* Merges of `master` into your feature branch

    - Instead rebase the feature branch on top of `master`
    - The result is a history that clearly shows your work without
      mixing it with upstream work

* Commits that don't compile/build/work

    - Instead make sure each commit makes sense on its own â€“ it
      should be a small incremental step towards some goal
    - This enables `git bisect` and ensures general sanity

* Commits that fix errors introduced earlier in same pull request

    - Instead commit the fix and use `git rebase -i` to squash the fix
      into the commit that introduced the error!

---

# Writing Good Commit Messages

Commit messages are an important tool! Take some time to write good
and helpful messages for your future self and your team mates.

* Explain *why* the change is made, not just *what* you did

    - `git diff` already shows what changed
    - Remove the need for your team mates to guess your thinking when
      looking at a change 6 weeks or 6 years later

* Reference issues, commits, and related information

    - Use the GitHub syntax for closing issues: `Fixes #123`
    - Link to bug reports in other projects that explains the problem

* Keep the subject line shorter than 50 characters, keep the body
  lines shorter than 80 characters

    - Displays better in terminals and online
